# Publication and Release

## Manuscript

The manuscript is modular under `paper/sections/`. Generated metadata, result macros,
and the claim table are staged into `paper/generated/`. Keep claims in prose consistent
with their registered status and use `references.bib` only for verified citations.

`paperkit build-paper --stage-only` works without TeX. Full compilation requires
`latexmk`; CI installs a TeX environment and compiles the manuscript independently.

## Interactive explainer

The Astro site imports `site/src/generated/site-data.json`, copied from
`artifacts/site-data.json` by `npm run sync`. Public pages may format and interact with
results, but must not recompute the study model. The included Playwright suite checks
desktop and mobile rendering, interaction, horizontal page overflow, console errors,
and axe accessibility rules.

Use Node 22.12 or newer:

```bash
npm ci --prefix site
npm run check --prefix site
npm run build --prefix site
npx --prefix site playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e --prefix site
```

## Release gate

`paperkit release --dry-run` always rebuilds evidence before validation. A real release
also compiles the paper and site, then atomically replaces `dist/` with deterministic
archives, citation metadata, and SHA-256 checksums. It never approves a gate.

Before release, verify that:

- all five gate records contain a human approver and ISO date;
- all manuscript and research placeholders are removed;
- every claim has accurate scope, status, limitations, and evidence;
- literature records and bibliography entries are verifiable;
- the extracted arXiv source compiles in a clean environment;
- the repository and site links in `project.yml` resolve to the public project.
